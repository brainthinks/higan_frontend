# Higan Frontend

A frontend for the Higan emulator.

Currently, it only supports NES, because that's currently all I have time to play.

## Getting Started

1. Open 2 terminals in this directory.
1. Terminal A:
    1. `cd server && yarn yarn run serve:dev "C:\Users\user\Desktop\games\nes`
1. Terminal B:
    1. `cd client && yarn run serve`
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
1. Click on the game you want to play
